Introduction
------------

Tharsis.prof is an open source `frame-based profiler
<http://defenestrate.eu/2014/09/05/frame_based_game_profiling.html>`_ library for the
D programming language. A frame-based profiler keeps track of overhead separately for
individual frames in a game. This is useful to track down issues with inconsistent
overhead (such as lag that appears only once in a few seconds) that are hard to detect
with conventional profilers.

Tharsis.prof is designed to be easy to use and lightweight. See the example below to get
started.

Note that this is still a **work in progress**. The API is not stable and there might be
compatibility **breaking changes** in future.


---------------
Getting started
---------------

Assuming you use `dub <http://code.dlang.org/about>`_, add this line::

   "tharsis.prof": { "version" : "~>0.1.0" }

to the ``"dependencies"`` in your project's ``dub.json``/``package.json``.

Tharsis.prof requires DMD 2.066 or equivalent GDC/LDC.


* Recording profiling data:

  .. code-block:: d

     import tharsis.prof;

     // Get 2 MB more than the minimum (maxEventBytes). Could also use malloc() here.
     ubyte[] storage = new ubyte[Profiler.maxEventBytes + 1024 * 1024 * 2];
     // Could use std.typecons.scoped! to avoid GC here.
     auto profiler = new Profiler(storage);

     while(!done)
     {
         auto frameZone = Zone(profiler, "frame");
         {
             auto renderingZone = Zone(profiler, "rendering");

             // do rendering here
         }
         {
             auto physicsZone = Zone(profiler, "physics");

             // do physics here
         }
     }

* Visualizing profiling data in real-time:

  See the `Despiker <https://github.com/kiith-sa/despiker>`_ project
  (`tutorial <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/despiker/tutorials/getting_started.html>`_).


* Processing profiling data in code:

  .. code-block:: d

      // Filter all instances of the "frame" zone
      auto zones = profiler.profileData.zoneRange;
      auto frames = zones.filter!(z => z.info == "frame");

      // Sort the frames by duration from longest to shortest.
      import std.container;
      // Builds an RAII array containing zones from frames. We need an array as we need
      // random access to sort the zones (ZoneRange generates ZoneData on-the-fly as it
      // processes profiling data, so it has no random access).
      auto frameArray = Array!ZoneData(frames);
      frameArray[].sort!((a, b) => a.duration > b.duration);

      import std.stdio;
      // Print the 4 longest frames.
      foreach(frame; frameArray[0 .. 4])
      {
          // In hectonanoseconds (tenths of microsecond)
          writeln(frame.duration);
      }

      // Print details about all zones in the worst frame.
      auto worst = frameArray[0];
      foreach(zone; zones.filter!(z => z.startTime >= worst.startTime && z.endTime <= worst.endTime))
      {
          writefln("%s: %s hnsecs from %s to %s",
                   zone.info, zone.duration, zone.startTime, zone.endTime);
      }

`API documentation <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/tharsis.prof/index.html>`_.

Features
--------

* Easy to use, RAII-style API for recording profiling data.
* Can be used together with `Despiker <https://github.com/kiith-sa/despiker>`_ to visually
  profile a game in real time (`tutorial
  <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/despiker/tutorials/getting_started.html>`_).
* Detailed `API documentation <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/tharsis.prof/index.html>`_
  with code examples.
* Profile data can be analyzed in real time within a game (between frames, or top-level
  zones)
* `Range-based API
  <http://defenestrate.eu/2014/09/05/frame_based_profiling_with_d_ranges.html>`_ for
  analyzing profile data; works with ``std.algorithm`` and other Phobos modules.
* No GC usage and no internal heap allocations (user must provide memory explicitly),
  except for exception handling if sending data to `Despiker
  <https://github.com/kiith-sa/despiker>`_
* Designed to use as little memory as possible in heavy workloads (but it can still use
  quite a lot). *Memory usage in light workloads has been improved*.
* Uses high-precision clocks (hectonanosecond - tenth of microsecond - precision).
* No dependencies.
